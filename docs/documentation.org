* Architecture
** State management
There is a single variable in the socket controller that holds mutable
state. State is modified using tasks, functions which take a state as
input and return a new state. Immutable state is passed around using
function closures.
** Concepts
*** Tasks
Tasks are functions that take state as input and return a new
state. Tasks are the only functions that may perform side effects.
*** Parsers
Parsers are pure functions that take an event as input and return a
task.
*** Matchers
Matchers are pure functions that take an event as input and return a
boolean.
*** Handlers
A handler is a combination of a matcher and a parser.
*** Dispatchers
A dispatcher is a function that takes an event, a sequence of handlers
and an optional default parser as input. The dispatcher collects
handlers that match the event and combines their parsers with the
event, outputting a single task. The dispatcher uses its default
parser if no handlers match the event.
